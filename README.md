#  Goal

The player needs to try to click all of the pictures without clicking on the same one twice, while the images re-arrange on every click. It is built in React.

# How-to

The game is all contained on one page. On loading the page, the user sees a collection of characters from Game of Thrones.

Every time the user clicks an image their score will go up by 1 and the images will shuffle, unless the user has already clicked the image. When the user has clicked an image that has already been clicked on the game will end and an alert will come up saying: get better. To see how the playerscore is changing open consolelog to observe your score.


Then, their score will return back to zero. If the winner has set a new highscore, the user will top score will be updated in consolelog.
